			<h2>What Are Cataracts?</h2>

					<p>By increasing the depth of focus and enhancing the quality of vision, our cataract surgery has the potential to make patients less dependent on eyeglasses.</p>
					<h3>What is a Cataract?</h3>
					<p>A cataract is a clouding of the natural lens inside the eye. Just as a dirty camera lens can spoil a picture, a cataract can prevent light from focusing clearly inside the eye. Cataracts develop in almost everyone sooner or later. The most common cause for cataracts is aging. Other factors are injury, excessive sunlight, toxic chemicals, changes in your body's metabolism, or drugs.</p></div>

				<h3>Detecting a Cataract</h3>
				<p>Cataracts can be diagnosed only by a thorough eye examination. An eye care practitioner must determine whether a cataract or other eye disorder may be affecting a patient's vision. The total health of your eyes and the quality of your eyesight are thoroughly examined. First, your vision is checked. Then a slit lamp is used to look inside your eye. Other devices may be used to determine if glare interferes with your vision.</p>
				<h3>Treating the Cataract</h3>
				<p>The decision to treat a cataract is reached by the eye care practitioner and the patient together. This decision is based on the degree to which the cataract is impairing vision and the effect of the impairment on the patient's quality of life.</p>
				<p>Since there is presently no medical treatment to prevent cataracts or reverse them once they develop, the only treatment for cataracts is surgical removal. Today's cataract surgery is a marvel of medical technology. Often, it is performed as an outpatient procedure, under local anesthesia. In most cases, the incision is so small that the eye heals rapidly with little or no discomfort.</p>
				<h3>Choosing the Intraocular Lens (IOL) that's Right for You</h3>
				<p>IOL technology has evolved rapidly during the past decade, and cataract patients may wish to discuss with their eye care practitioner their choice of IOLs. All types of IOLs offer improved vision after cataract surgery.</p>
